# Burrow-Wheeler-Transform
In this implementation I want to allow different kind of transform by modifying the alphabetical order.
This modification in the method may represent a way to encrypt data.
Lowercase, uppercase, numbers and basic punctuation is considered in the alphabet. 
New line is considered too in the transform, with a special treatment.
