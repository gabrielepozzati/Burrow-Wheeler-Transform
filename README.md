# Burrow-Wheeler-Transform
In this implementation I want to allow different kinds of transform by possibly modifying the alphabetical order.
This modification in the method may represent a way to encrypt data.

Lowercase, uppercase, numbers and basic punctuation is considered in the alphabet which is stored in config.txt file. 
Subsequently, characters which are not present in config.txt should not be present in the input text for the correct execution of the program. New line is allowed in the transform, due to a special treatment.
